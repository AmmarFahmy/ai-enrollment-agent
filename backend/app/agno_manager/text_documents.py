## Financial Aid

Hello

In order to apply for financial aid you will first need to fill out your FAFSA.  Once we receive your results from the Department of Education (typically 3-5 business days) we will send out an award letter within the next 2 weeks.

Here is more detailed information about how financial aid works: https://www.iit.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-and-aid/applying-financial-aid

I would also encourage you to speak with Financial Aid directly once you submit your FAFSA and you can schedule an appointment here: https://calendly.com/illinois-tech-office-of-financial-aid

Let us know if you have any other questions

Thanks

for domestic students:

Hello

You can find all the costs associated with the graduate program here:  https://www.iit.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-and-aid/graduate-costs-and-aid

If you have additional questions you can also book time with a financial aid advisor at this link:  https://calendly.com/illinois-tech-office-of-financial-aid

Thanks

### GRE and uploading scores
Hello

GRE is required for PhD programs and typically GRE scores are not able to be waived and are required to ensure an admissions decision.  

Please submit your scores as soon as possible.  If you are unable to provide GRE scores, we recommend switching to a Master's program as the GRE is not required for those programs. 

If you have an unofficial score report, please upload your unofficial score report to the application status page.

Please note you will need to have the testing agency send us your official scores as well.  You will not be able to enroll until we receive the officials, the unofficial report is only for admission decision purposes. 

Let us know if you have any questions

Thank you

### I-20 REquest

Hello

Have you been admitted yet, you will need to be admitted and then deposited before you can proceed to requesting your I-20.

Your first step is submitting your deposit That needs to be completed first before proceeding to the rest of the steps in this message.

We moved everything to your application status page that you already are using and that's where you will find your I-20 request form.

Once you have submitted your deposit within 2-4 business days you should have an update on your application status page.  Please go to your status page right away.

If you scroll to the bottom of the page you will see a new form called I-20 Request Form - click on it to pull it up.

This is where you will submit all your documents:
 Passport
 Financial Documents (including your Financial Affidavit of Responsibility Form)
 SEVIS Record Transfer form (if applicable)

Read the whole document carefully and select Yes or No at the bottom.  This will trigger the next part of the form.

Once this happens read each section carefully and fill out all necessary information & upload all your documents in the designated areas. (Don't forget to upload your Financial Affidavit of Responsibility Form)

Then hit submit at the bottom.

The expected turnaround time if everything is submitted correctly is about 1 week.  Your I-20 will go to your personal email & copied to your official Hawk email address for you to download.

If you need to redo anything you will get an update on your status page and a new form will appear at the bottom called Insufficient Documents Resubmission Form. - Follow the prompts and resubmit any required documentation.

#Aplication Fee Waiver

Hello,

We do not currently have an application fee waiver promotion at this time.

If you are a domestic student (a student who does not require a visa), you can receive a fee waiver by attending a virtual advising appointment with your Enrollment Counselor.  You can sign up for those here

Domestic students can also attend an Domestic Student Information Session to receive a waiver as well.  You can find the Information Session schedule here

Otherwise there are sometimes select events throughout the year that offer application fee waivers watch the event page for details.

Thank you
